# Telecom Churn Prediction 📡📊

This project predicts customer churn in the telecom industry using various **machine learning classification algorithms**.  
The goal is to identify customers likely to leave the service provider and help businesses take preventive actions.

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Model Training**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - XGBoost
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Bernoulli Naive Bayes
   - Gaussian Naive Bayes

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy comparison across models
   - Baseline results (before hyperparameter tuning)
